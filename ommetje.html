            <h1>Ommetje</h1>
            <p>
                During my User Experience Design minor, I followed a course "Seductive Interaction Design", where I learned several ways to use seductive patterns to help
                users achieve their goals. I was allowed to combine this course with the HCI Mastery course where I
                learned to give the app a personality with micro interactions and animation.
            </p>
            <p>The Dutch Brain Foundation has created the Ommetje app to encourage people to walk outside every day. It
                is based on research that walking for 20 minutes a day keeps a person mentally healthy. It turned out
                that the app was not of interest to people under 40, so the task was to improve it so that more people
                under 40 use it.
            </p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>Before starting the design process, I started researching the existing app through user tests. This
                allowed me to map out the pain points to improve the app and make it more attractive for the target
                group 18 to 40 years old. It turned out that the app was boring and didn't motivate the user enough to
                use while walking.
            </p>

            <p>
                By means of a customer journey, I mapped out how the user progresses through the app, in which I could
                see what their expectations look like.

            <h3>Postulates I've used: </h3 
<ul>            <li>Information technology is never neutral (Persuasive systems should be able to adapt to changes.) </li>
            <li>People like their views about the world to be organized and consistent (This is based on the idea of
                ​​commitment and cognitive consistency [Cialdini et al. 1981]. If systems support the making of
                commitments, users will more likely be persuaded.) </li>
            <li>Direct and indirect routes are key persuasion strategies. (This postulate implies that a user's
                personal background and the use situation have an influence on their information processing. When the
                user has a high motivation and a high ability, they are more likely interested in the content of the
                persuasive message than when they have a low motivation and a low ability.) </li>
            <li>Persuasion is often incremental (This implies that a persuasive system should enable making
                incremental steps toward target behavior.) </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Final Delivery</h2>
            <p>
                I redesigned the Ommetje app with a brand new look and based on the users' needs and wants.
                For final delivery, I presented the product based on the prototype and my research results.
