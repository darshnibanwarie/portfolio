            <h1>NS Afhaal</h1>
            <p>
                This was my last school project as a CMD student. The project lasted a total of 8 weeks in which I
                focused on devising a multi-device travel app with 2 phases.
            </p>
            <p> The problem that I wanted to tackle was that NS travelers want to buy food or drinks before their train
                journey, however this is not possible due to short transfer time. I wanted to design an app where they
                can order food/drinks and pick it up from a vending machine right outside their train. </p>
            <p class="bold-designch"> Design challenge: “How can NS help travelers to buy food during their short
                transfer time?”</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>In the first weeks I conducted content research to determine which data will be available in the
                solution and how this can be implemented. This also gave me insight into what restrictions can arise,
                such as: a product is no longer available in the vending machine and people who suffer from allergies.
            </p>

            <p>
                After mapping all this, I continued to research the customer journey by means of a customer journey map.
                I found obstacles such as: the platform is very busy, people do not understand how a QR code works and a
                payment has been interrupted due to technical reasons. And finally, I performed iterations based on peer
                feedback sessions
            </p>

            <h2>In the project I used the following research methods:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Content research</li>
                <li>Customer Journey Mapping </li>
                <li>UX theory (Donna Spencer and Nir Eyal) </li>
                <li>Research on sitemaps </li>
                <li>Peer design critique</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Product goal</h2>
        <p>The main goal of the platform is that users can quickly buy consumables during their short transfer time, so they have something to eat/drink during their long train trip.</p>
        
        <p>
                For the final delivery, I had to present the product with a report of my process during the 8 weeks and
                with a design document explaining my design choices.
