            <h1>Project Beyond</h1>
            <p>
                This project lasted a total of 8 weeks and consisted of several courses that connected to it. I was in a
                team with Rosa Voogd, Romy Wiedijk and Simon Planje. A very nice team that I felt comfortable working
                with. For this project we had chosen the case of reducing PET bottles at the AUAS.
            </p>
            <p> Our design challenge: "How can we reduce the use of PET bottles on the HvA Campus?"
            </p>
            <p>
                For this we have devised an interactive design to support this.
            </p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>First of all, we researched how often people at the AUAS buy plastic bottles and research into how
                plastic pollutes the environment.
            </p>
            <img src="images/survey.png" alt="research results">
            <p>
                To map out the target group's wishes, experiences, behavior and goals, we created a persona based on our
                research.
            </p>
            <img src="images/persona_mees.png" alt="persona">
            <p>To visually present the user's experience, we used a customer journey. This was based on our own
                experience when we forget our bottle of water at home.</p>
            <img src="images/cjm.png" alt="customer journey mapping">

            <p>In week 4, the group brainstormed together to come up with a number of ideas. The group came up with a
                number of nice ideas via ideation, of which we have worked out 4 and chosen 1 of them. Critical
                consideration was also required to determine whether the idea is feasible. In the end we opted for a
                common table idea that we now want to conceptualize further.</p>
            <P>After all the research, we brainstormed together as a group to come up with a number of ideas for the
                final concept. We have worked out 4 of these and selected 1. We opted for a shared table where the user
                could connect to his bottle to play a game of AI hockey with his peers. We also had to think carefully
                about whether the idea is feasible.</P>

            <h2>How does our concept work?</h2>
            <p>In the storyboard we visualize how a group of students uses our concept. The students all purchase a fair
                bottle in which they can drink water and also play air hockey. In this way, the use of PET bottles is
                reduced.</p>

            <h2>Final Delivery</h2>
            <p>
                For the final delivery, we had to present the process, the prototype and the product video to our coach.
