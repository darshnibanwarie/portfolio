            <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!</h1>
        </div>

        <img src="images/self_portrait.png" alt="Profile picture">
        <p>My name is Darshni Banwarie, I'm 23 years old and I study Communication and Multimedia Design at the
            Hogeschool van Amsterdam. I'm currently in my 4th year. I was born and raised in Paramaribo,
            Suriname. I moved to the Netherlands when I was 18 to pursue further education.</p>
        <p>During my education I mainly focused on User Experience Design. I enjoy working in creative teams because
            that's when we can come up with the
            best solutions for design problems. I think it is important to be well prepared,
            to work neatly and structured. I am a hard worker with an eye for detail. Because of my sense of
            responsibility and the ability to plan tasks well, I ensure that I always finish projects on time.
        </p>

        <p>In my culture-rich motherland I learned several languages such as Dutch, English, Sarnami,
            Sranantongo and un poquito Spanish. My knowledge of various backgrounds make it possible for me to
            put myself in users' shoes and solving issues that at first seem impossible.</p>



        <p>I love connecting with people and learning from them. Besides that I work really well in teams, because I'm a
            teamplayer, probably because I'm
            most creative when I work with other equally creative people. And I can also handle feedback and adjust my
            work well. I'm a very open person for discussions.
        </p>

        <p>I learned in my second year of education that I absolutely love User Experience Design, so I took every
            opportunity to learn more about it by partaking in UX projects.

            Because I think it's interesting to try and understand people their perspectives, their frustrations, their
            workflows and their joys. It's fun to see how the solution can improve people's lives and how much easier
            they can accomplish something. </p>

            <h2>More about me</h2>
        </div>

        <p>In my free time I love to visit the gym, I do a lot of weight lifting because I care about my
            health. I also think
            it's very cool to lift heavy stuff.</p>
        <p>If I'm not in the gym I also love going out with my friends and trying new food.</p>

                <h3>UI & Visual Design</h3>
                <p>I'm a skilled visual designer with an eye for typography, layout, graphics and color. I love building
                    functional software & mobile products and implementing modern aesthetics.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column1">
                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>I believe that user research is the most important step of the design process. I love speaking to
                    users
                    and understanding their process & problems first, before even considering design.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column2">
                <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                <p>I'm skilled in prototyping products with users and stakeholders across the entire design lifecycle. I
                    love using the Figma tool to wireframe and prototype designs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column3">
                <h3>Cognitive Psychology</h3>
                <p>I've taken a course on consumer psychology and understanding how users think, behave, and interact
                    with products. I believe in analyzing user behavior for an interaction science-backed approach.</p>
