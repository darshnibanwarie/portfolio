        <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!</h1>
    </div>
        <p>My name is Darshni Banwarie, I'm 23 years old and I study Communication and Multimedia Design at the
            Hogeschool van Amsterdam. I'm currently in my 4th year. I was born and raised in Paramaribo, Suriname. I
            moved to the Netherlands when I was 18 to pursue further education.</p>

            <p>In my culture-rich motherland I learned several languages such as Dutch, English, Sarnami, Sranantongo and un poquito Spanish.</p>

        <p>I learned in my second year of education that I absolutely love User Experience Design, so I took every
            opportunity to learn more about it by partaking in UX projects.</p>


        <p>I love connecting with people and learning. I work really well in teams because I'm a teamplayer. I think I'm
            most creative when I work with other equally creative people. And I can also handle feedback and adjust my
            work well. I'm a very open person for discussions.
        </p>

        <h2>More about me</h2>
    </div>
        <p>I work out in my free time, I do a lot of weight lifting because I care about my health. I also think
            it's very cool to lift heavy stuff.</p>

                <h3>UI & Visual Design</h3>
                <p>I'm a skilled visual designer with an eye for typography, layout, graphics and color. I love building
                    functional software & mobile products and implementing modern aesthetics.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column1">
                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>I believe that user research is the most important step of the design process. I love speaking to
                    users
                    and understanding their process & problems first, before even considering design.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column2">
                <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                <p>I'm skilled in prototyping products with users and stakeholders across the entire design lifecycle. I
                    love using the Figma tool to wireframe and prototype designs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column3">
                <h3>Cognitive Psychology</h3>
                <p>I've taken a course on consumer psychology and understanding how users think, behave, and interact
                    with
                    products. I believe in analyzing user behavior for an interaction science-backed approach.</p>
