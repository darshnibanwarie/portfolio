        <p>My name is Darshni Banwarie, I'm a 24 year old UX Designer and Researcher hoping to further my career in the design space.
        <p>I was born and raised in Paramaribo, Suriname. I moved to the Netherlands when I was 18 to pursue further education. When I moved to the Netherlands, I realized I had a unique perspective of the world - being Surinamese. I learned everyone has a story to tell, and it's important to be open to change and fresh ideas.</p>
        <p>I have had a love for psychology and creativity since I was in high school. After personal struggles with anxiety and depression, I became fascinated with the way people think, feel, and behave - and how products could help them live more fulfilling lives. I graduated from University of Applied Sciences (HvA) in April of 2023 with a HBO Bachelor in Communication and Multimedia Design. And a minor in User Experience Design.</p>
        <p>I mainly focused on User Experience Design and Research during my education. I took every opportunity to learn more about it by partaking in UX projects. Because I think it's interesting to try and understand people their perspectives, their frustrations, their
            workflows and their joys. It's amazing to see how the solution can improve people's lives and how much easier they can accomplish something.
        </p>
        <p>In my culture-rich motherland I learned several languages such as Dutch (native), English, Sarnami, Sranantongo y un poquito Spanish. My knowledge of various backgrounds make it possible for me to put myself in users' shoes and solve issues that at first seem impossible. </p>

        <p>I have basic HTML and CSS skills, which is very useful in multidisciplinary settings (and for creating portfolios).</p>

        <p>Outside of design, I'm a major gym fanatic, and enjoy exploring the green outdoors with a coffee in my hand. My fun fact is I like to travel solo and explore new cities.
        </p>
        <p>Currently, I'm seeking a new job opportunity in User Experience Design or User Experience Research.

            I'm always down to have a coffee and discuss a new job opportunity or to talk. Reach out and let's chat!

                <h3>UI & Visual Design</h3>
                <p>I'm a skilled visual designer with an eye for typography, layout, graphics and color. I love building
                    functional software & mobile products and implementing modern aesthetics.</p>

            <div class="column1">
                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>I believe that user research is the most important step of the design process. I love speaking to
                    users
                    and understanding their process & problems first, before even considering design.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column2">
                <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                <p>I'm skilled in prototyping products with users and stakeholders across the entire design lifecycle. I
                    love using the Figma tool to wireframe and prototype designs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column3">
                <h3>Cognitive Psychology</h3>
                <p>I've taken a course on consumer psychology and understanding how users think, behave, and interact
                    with products. I believe in analyzing user behavior for an interaction science-backed approach.</p>
