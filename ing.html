            <h1>ING Personal interface</h1>
            <p>
                Commissioned by ING, my teammates and I focused on devising and designing
                a personal user interface. Our target group (seniors 60-80 years old) ran into a number of problems.
                Such as the ongoing digitization that saddles seniors with a disadvantage in the field of digital
                knowledge.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a result, a certain group of seniors still avoids online banking. And we wanted to help
                them by offering them a safe online environment to manage their banking affairs.
            </p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>This project lasted a total of 4 months and consisted of several courses that connected with this
                project.

                <p>
                    Design challenge: "How can ING help seniors to arrange their online banking in an easy and safe way
                    using a personal interface?"
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                In the first phase, we conducted several interviews, observed the target group and did desk research to map their
                wants and needs. After mapping all this, we started brainstorming to generate ideas
                for our solution directions.

            <p>
                As a result of this brainstorming session, we have been busy making prototypes and testing with the
                target group which they liked the best. Based on the results of the various user tests, we have made
                choices and several iterations. This eventually brought us to the current concept.

            <p>
                Our research showed that these three values are the most important for the target group: convenience,
                safety
                and reliability.
            </p>
            <h2>Product goal</h2>
            <p>The main goal of the ING personal interface is to encourage seniors (age 60+) to do more online banking without the help of their closed ones and include them in the age of digitization.</p>

            <h2>Final Delivery</h2>
            <p>
                For final delivery, we presented our final concept to ING and our coach. Here we showed the bottlenecks,
                the process, validation and the prototype. Click the link below to test our prototype.
